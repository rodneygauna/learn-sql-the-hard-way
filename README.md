# Learn SQL The Hard Way

## Exercise 1

Learned about creating a table using `CREATE TABLE`.

Using the info from the exercise, I made the 'person' table with the following 4 columns:

* id
* first_name
* last_name
* age

Make 'id' an INTEGER and the PRIMARY KEY, 'first_name' as TEXT, 'last_name' also as TEXT, and 'age' as an INTEGER.

Also learned about the terminal to turn the SQL file into a database using `sqlite3 ex1.db < ex1.sql`.
